      "The issue is cause by the source. There is large current ratio change from one step to the other. When divider cap moves chamber impedance changes so source match needs to retune. If the div cap is changing too fast then the match is over reacting and the system gets shaken. I am familiar with the issue because I worked with Toru Masaky who created the presentation included. I suggested two things change VSWR. It will make the dead band of the match narrower and will make the match to react earlier (smaller impedance change which can improve the tuning a bit. This is not enough though. The best is to change the speed of the divider cap in the match as suggested in the presentation. \n",
      "With the bias match you just got lucky. Generally you are preventing the match from overreacting and how the match works depends on the input sensor calibration and there can be small differences from match to match. By swapping the matches you have changed how the matches react to the impedance change and simply got lucky. I really do not have an explanation why it improved and do not believe the issue is fixed. As I said the issue is with the source. If you do not solve the root cause you are relying on luck and sooner or later the issue will reappear.\n",

Once they get the initial alarm the alarms persistently keep coming back including E2 alarms until they reset the controller back to default settings ($$$*** which clears the memory). The customer is not happy having to do the controller reset every 6 months or so. The site team has also asked if they could power down/up the tool to clear any alarms on a quarterly basis which was rejected by the customer. CEN 030 covers the E2 alarms caused by noise on the ACC-82M macro cards. A retrofit is available to add an inline isolation transformer. I do not recall if this retrofit has been done. Another solution would be to replace the ACC-83M macro cards which the customer has rejected because of the cost. The problem with this solution is there is no guarantee this will eliminate the E2 alarms. The only other option is to upgrade the whole system to the geo Brick controller which eliminates the ACC-82M macro cards all together.\n",

The normal esc voltage reads -800 in the OE step, but the system in question drops to -600. The OE step is not a back to abck condition but a condition that RF is turned on again after stable step.Older equipment does not have these symptoms. The SBC is new parts, so you must use software 4.0 or higher, and the RF generator and match part numbers are different. The software of the problem-free equipment is 3.5_76 and the software of the faulty equipment is 4.0_40.\n",

      "- As we talked by phone, please explain it to customer who know the brush situation during processing. The silicon and device side brush torque value, it based on wafer surface coefficient of friction.  Due to the silicon side wafer surface coefficient of friction is higher with device side so the silicon side torque higher than device side at the begin tool running. In the processing, the brush surface material be consumed, so silicon side brush be consumed faster than device side when brush life time is increasing at the same gap. So the brush torque value will be changed on the  contrary. From your information which is from F16 customer, the defect performance is based on silicon side torque higher. As I know that F14B customer ran brush gap with  gap LUT command by CIM automatic for keeping same brush torque on 17~21. Maybe it???s on 19 % torque until brush life time end.  For my thinking, I don???t think the torque difference in silicon/device side wafer , it???s not direct to defect performance, so we can inspect some items to clarify this case.\n",

      "After further troubleshooting of the FI robot, we found that the relay inside the robot controller was not actuating, leading usto conclude that the controller was faulty. To test this, we installed PLM611???s robot controller in the training tool PLM999 and found that we received the same initialization error. After this, we tested PLM999???s robot controller and used it as a known-good part to install on PLM611, as well as replacing PLM611???s robot track cables (both from the controller to track and track to robot). After this, we were able to turn on motor power with the teach pendant, move all axis, and initialize successfully with the software. The running theory is that a fault in the robot track cables was causing an intermittent connection issue and permanently damaging the controller in the process. Replacing the controller appeared to resolve the issue each time, since it was no longer a damaged unit, until the faulty connection occurred again during robot movement and damaged the controller.\n",

This is still an enigma since this was all induced by a VITA upgrade that had nothing to do with the driver cables.   The only explanation we have is the pin had conductivity until we removed power and after we energized the system the pin connection became an open.  It is unfortunate that the new cable was bad, causing a long downtime and a change in trouble shooting methodology.

Also due to the platen lift fault and/or the tracking issue, a wafer exchange error was generated and the tool sat idle for 10-15 minutes. Some transport mid-level commands were used in what appears to be an effort to recover the wafers from the tool. During the recovery and because of the wafer tracking error, the wafers were placed back into the cassette. With wafer walkout disabled, the tool would not have known that they were not placed back into the cassette correctly. The elevator was mapped and the wafers were broken. The timing between the return to the cassette and the mapping was very short, which assumes that a visual inspection of the transfer did take place. \n",

That explains the defect map at 4/10 shows edge map. For bad pump efficiency , it let chamber status getting worse and worse and lead to full map defect. The bad pump efficiency also contaminated chamber process  kits, mixer , faceplate , block plate, gas feedthrough, Y tube, liquid POU , liquid divert valve and liquid divert POU. Which explains after LAT replaced the pump at 4/29, the defect cluster at center of wafer and has no defect at edge. Thus, after wet clean and replaced parts between faceplate to divert valve, the defect issue was solved.\n",

      "\n",
      "(A1) On TW, no NC for 0010-57159 which clearly describes scratch issue caused by clamp.\n",
      "From revision2 of 0010-57159, bolt dicing step has been added for assembling.\n",
      "But no clear cleaning method is not being specified for post dicing process.\n",
      "So HC is suspecting cause of scratches is coming from clamp bolt.\n",
      "Ishii san will ask customer to perform ultrasonic cleaningbefore using new 0010-57159 rev2.\n",
      "\n",
      "(A2) Regarding to head clamp cleaning at inside polisher, no AMAT retrofit seems available.\n",
      "New head/platen wash tower and stay-clean don't clean head clamp area.\n",
      "HC suggested to modify IPC bar or introduce head/platen wash towers and modify them.\n",
      "Ordering head/platen wash tower should be through NSO.\n",
      "However, retrofitting new wash towers or modifying IPC bars are impossible for now.\n",

      "From FA:\n",
      "The failure most likely, is due to some form of electrical failure, causing PCB to overheat.  Without fully understanding the end application of the PCB, HEI can only assume that some form of ignition occurred at the two locations, LP705 Pin 2 and LPE10, producing enough heat and burning thru the polyimide material (Arlon 25N/85N laminate has a decomposition temperature of >400??C).  It is possible that the electrical failure could be the result of an arc flash from an intermittent connection, in this case, between a heating lamp and the PCB.  The interface between the PCB and heating lamp is thru the Mill-Max receptacle.  For intermittent contact to occur at this interface, the only two possibilities that would cause/produce poor contact is an oversized plated thru hole, or a faulty receptacle, specifically, the internal contacts of such receptacle.\n",
      "The other possibility that could have produced an intermittent contact is from the receptacle to the lamp pin itself.  Mill-Max receptacle PN: 0366-0-15-15-13-27-10-0 (AMAT PN: 2902-670) has contacts/clips made of Beryllium Copper.  Beryllium Copper, per Mill-Max, is not recommended for use at high temp applications.  For high temp applications, they recommend contacts/clips made with Beryllium Nickel, where, ???The primary advantage of using a Beryllium Nickel contact clip in place of a Beryllium Copper equivalent is the improved resistance to annealing in high temperature applications???.  Along with receptacle contacts/clips made of Be Cu, is the mounting requirement for the receptacles.  Existing receptacles are for mounting into Non-Plated Thru Holes; Mill-Max does not, ???recommend press-fit mounting the 0366 receptacle into a plated through hole. The primary reason for this is that the knurl press-fit feature machined on this product does not provide enough relief during press-fit mounting. This lack of relief opens the possibility of damage to both the receptacle and the mounting hole itself; for example, the development of voids in the mounting hole platin\n",
